This is my ideal layout of the ATM screen of SEHH2242 Object Oriented Programming. 

The layout of ATM references the ATM of HSBC as the layout and BOCHK as the interactions: 
- The ratio of the ATMs of HSBC is 3:2.
- Users can touch the ATM screen of BOCHK, this programme is using mouse cursor as users' hands to interact with the layout.

It is assumed that the layout represents the <b>screen</b> of the ATM only, and this is the advice from Pin Ng, so there is no physical keyboard (buttons). If your lecturer requires you to add keyboard (buttons) to the layout, you may download the layout from other classmates or senpais of HKCC (I rmb the source is public and it is completely programmed, so it is submitable)
